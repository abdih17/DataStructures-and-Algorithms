__Stacks:__
======

A stack is a data structure based on the principle 'Last In First Out'. Stacks are containers that hold nodes and has two primary operations — push and pop. The push operation is to add nodes into the stack and pop operation is to delete nodes from the stack and returns the top most node.

Here are all of the operations used on a Stack:

1. pop [pop()] - removes the top item from the stack.

2. push [push()] - inserts an item to the top of the stack.

3. peek [peek()] - returns the elements of the item without removing the data from the stack.

4. empty [isEmpty()] - returns true if and only if the stack is empty.

### Developer Application:

Here's a simple use-case for stacks — your browser’s back button. You would create a stack of URLs as you browser through the web, which in the background is pushing (using the push operation) every new URL on top of that stack. If you press the back button, it would pop off the current URL therefore utilizing the essence of a stack data structure.

### Real World Application:

This sequential order is commonly described as a stack of dishes at a cafeteria. When a plate is added to a stack of dishes, the plate retains the order of when it was added; moreover, when a plate is added, it is pushed towards the bottom of a stack. Every time we add a new plate, the plate is pushed towards the bottom of the stack, but it also represents the top of the stack of plates.
