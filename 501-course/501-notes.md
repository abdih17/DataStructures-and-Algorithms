__501 DS & A Notes:__
======

###DAY 1:

- Software Based: Algorithm- the mechanics of coding anything
  - Language: Python, JavaScript, C++..
  - Application Program: Stock purchase
- Hardware: Instruction Set Architecture (I/0 Interface): is the language the CPU accepts so that it can compile/interpret the language (Python, Java..) we send through code.
- Digit System: finite number of symbols
- Binary (base 2) System: has two states which is 0 and 1
  - Recognize two conditions:
    - presence of voltage - state of "1"
    - absence of voltage - state of "2" (??)


- CPU: Fetch - Decode - Execute
  - Main Memory: holds memory transferred from the user.
  - Bus(??): is the transition of memory from the main memory to the CPU
  - CPU Chip: is that acts on the memory transitioned from the main memory and RAM(!!)
  - Registers: (??) CPU has a limited register to operate on.
  - ALU (!!): exposed to a wide range of interfaces


#####Analysis of Algorithms Refresher:

  - Purpose: For the sake of scaling
  - Growth Rate(!!)
  - RAM Model of Computation:
    - simple model independent of machine or programming language
      - Cost = 1 : Each 'simple' operations
      - Cost 2 - Loop is proportional to size of dataset
      - Cost 3 - Each 'memory' operation


  - Bubble Sort (!!)
  - Improving Complexity: Tradeoff of space and time

#####Basic Data Structures:
