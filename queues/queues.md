__Queues:__
======

Similar to a stack, a queue is a linear data structure. Unlike a stack, a queue deletes only the oldest added data.


### Real World Application:

Imagine a queue being very similar to the ticketing system of a deli. Each customer takes a ticket and is served when their number is called. The customer who takes the first ticket should be served first.

Let's further imagine that this ticket has the number "one" displayed on it. The next ticket has the number "two" displayed on it. The customer who takes the second ticket will be served second. (If our ticketing system operated like a stack, the customer who entered the stack first would be the last to be served!)
